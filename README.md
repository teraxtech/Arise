# CAsim
This is a simulator for outer-totalistic, generations, elementary, and non-isotropic rules made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When in draw mode, place cells by clicking on the grid with the primary mouse button. Change states with the menu next to the draw button, and "auto" switches  between states 0 and 1. This is also the state used with the fill action.

When in move mode, navigate by clicking and dragging the grid.

When in select mode, select an area by clicking and dragging the edges. 

Randomize, clear, fill, invert, and copy will only affect the highlighted area. Clicking paste once will show you the copied pattern and clicking paste again will place the pattern.

Restart will return the pattern to how it was before it was played.
