# CAsim
This is a simulator for outer-totalistic, generations, and non-isotropic rules made with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

When in select mode, select an area by clicking then dragging the edges. Randomize, clear, and copy will only affect the highlighted area. Clicking paste once will show you the copied pattern and clicking paste again will place the pattern. Restart will put the simulation in the state before it was played.
